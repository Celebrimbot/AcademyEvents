Monthly management accounts are being produced.

The audit committee have requested a comprehensive set of financial regulations to maintain the propriety and regularity of financial transactions; management and oversight of assets and ensure efficiency and value for money in the academy’s activities. In the interim the academy has adopted the financial regulations and standing orders from the former LA, in addition to the school’s financial procedures.

The audit committee have requested a review be undertaken by senior officers and business managers to identify and assess  potential risks of the school and the trust. An initial review has been undertaken and the identified risks recorded into a risk register together with a current assessment of their likelihood and impact against the academy trust’s ongoing operations.

The MAT are currently working on the financial policies and procedures to include handbooks for staff with key financial responsibilities. It is hoped that the handbooks will act as both a reminder of the individuals roles and responsibilties and also as a training tool for both existing and future staff. Whilst the MAT expects to have approved policies and procedures in place within the next few months it recognises that these will need to be reviewed and their suitablility tested over the coming 12 months to ensure that they are fit for purpose.

It was identified at an early stage that it would be beneficial for both schools for Malet Lambert to join South Hunsley Trust, who are an experienced trust and have been running for a number of years.  This original date of transfer was due to be 1st Jan 2016, however this was delayed by a month.  This is the main reason why they were more No's than Yes's on this return.  Please also note the date for the target date has been set as the 12th March, due to not being able to set a date in the past.  However these items have been actioned from the date we joined the trust which is 1st Feb 2016.
